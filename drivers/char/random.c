/*
 * (now, with legal B.S. out of the way.....)
 *
 * This routine gathers environmental noise from device drivers, etc.,
 * and returns good random numbers, suitable for cryptographic use.
 * Besides the obvious cryptographic uses, these numbers are also good
 * for seeding TCP sequence numbers, and other places where it is
 * desirable to have numbers which are not only random, but hard to
 * predict by an attacker.
 *
 * Theory of operation
 * ===================
 *
 * Computers are very predictable devices.  Hence it is extremely hard
 * to produce truly random numbers on a computer --- as opposed to
 * pseudo-random numbers, which can easily generated by using a
 * algorithm.  Unfortunately, it is very easy for attackers to guess
 * the sequence of pseudo-random number generators, and for some
 * applications this is not acceptable.  So instead, we must try to
 * gather "environmental noise" from the computer's environment, which
 * must be hard for outside attackers to observe, and use that to
 * generate random numbers.  In a Unix environment, this is best done
 * from inside the kernel.
 *
 * Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard
 * timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other
 * events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an
 * outside observer to measure.  Randomness from these sources are
 * added to an "entropy pool", which is mixed using a CRC-like function.
 * This is not cryptographically strong, but it is adequate assuming
 * the randomness is not chosen maliciously, and it is fast enough that
 * the overhead of doing it on every interrupt is very reasonable.
 * As random bytes are mixed into the entropy pool, the routines keep
 * an *estimate* of how many bits of randomness have been stored into
 * the random number generator's internal state.
 *
 * When random bytes are desired, they are obtained by taking the SHA
 * hash of the contents of the "entropy pool".  The SHA hash avoids
 * exposing the internal state of the entropy pool.  It is believed to
 * be computationally infeasible to derive any useful information
 * about the input of SHA from its output.  Even if it is possible to
 * analyze SHA in some clever way, as long as the amount of data
 * returned from the generator is less than the inherent entropy in
 * the pool, the output data is totally unpredictable.  For this
 * reason, the routine decreases its internal estimate of how many
 * bits of "true randomness" are contained in the entropy pool as it
 * outputs random numbers.
 *
 * If this estimate goes to zero, the routine can still generate
 * random numbers; however, an attacker may (at least in theory) be
 * able to infer the future output of the generator from prior
 * outputs.  This requires successful cryptanalysis of SHA, which is
 * not believed to be feasible, but there is a remote possibility.
 * Nonetheless, these numbers should be useful for the vast majority
 * of purposes.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- output
 * ===============================
 *
 * There are four exported interfaces; two for use within the kernel,
 * and two for use from userspace.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- userspace output
 * -----------------------------------------
 *
 * The userspace interfaces are two character devices /dev/random and
 * /dev/urandom.  /dev/random is suitable for use when very high
 * quality randomness is desired (for example, for key generation or
 * one-time pads), as it will only return a maximum of the number of
 * bits of randomness (as estimated by the random number generator)
 * contained in the entropy pool.
 *
 * The /dev/urandom device does not have this limit, and will return
 * as many bytes as are requested.  As more and more random bytes are
 * requested without giving time for the entropy pool to recharge,
 * this will result in random numbers that are merely cryptographically
 * strong.  For many applications, however, this is acceptable.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- kernel output
 * --------------------------------------
 *
 * The primary kernel interface is
 *
 * 	void get_random_bytes(void *buf, int nbytes);
 *
 * This interface will return the requested number of random bytes,
 * and place it in the requested buffer.  This is equivalent to a
 * read from /dev/urandom.
 *
 * For less critical applications, there are the functions:
 *
 * 	u32 get_random_u32()
 * 	u64 get_random_u64()
 * 	unsigned int get_random_int()
 * 	unsigned long get_random_long()
 *
 * These are produced by a cryptographic RNG seeded from get_random_bytes,
 * and so do not deplete the entropy pool as much.  These are recommended
 * for most in-kernel operations *if the result is going to be stored in
 * the kernel*.
 *
 * Specifically, the get_random_int() family do not attempt to do
 * "anti-backtracking".  If you capture the state of the kernel (e.g.
 * by snapshotting the VM), you can figure out previous get_random_int()
 * return values.  But if the value is stored in the kernel anyway,
 * this is not a problem.
 *
 * It *is* safe to expose get_random_int() output to attackers (e.g. as
 * network cookies); given outputs 1..n, it's not feasible to predict
 * outputs 0 or n+1.  The only concern is an attacker who breaks into
 * the kernel later; the get_random_int() engine is not reseeded as
 * often as the get_random_bytes() one.
 *
 * get_random_bytes() is needed for keys that need to stay secret after
 * they are erased from the kernel.  For example, any key that will
 * be wrapped and stored encrypted.  And session encryption keys: we'd
 * like to know that after the session is closed and the keys erased,
 * the plaintext is unrecoverable to someone who recorded the ciphertext.
 *
 * But for network ports/cookies, stack canaries, PRNG seeds, address
 * space layout randomization, session *authentication* keys, or other
 * applications where the sensitive data is stored in the kernel in
 * plaintext for as long as it's sensitive, the get_random_int() family
 * is just fine.
 *
 * Consider ASLR.  We want to keep the address space secret from an
 * outside attacker while the process is running, but once the address
 * space is torn down, it's of no use to an attacker any more.  And it's
 * stored in kernel data structures as long as it's alive, so worrying
 * about an attacker's ability to extrapolate it from the get_random_int()
 * CRNG is silly.
 *
 * Even some cryptographic keys are safe to generate with get_random_int().
 * In particular, keys for SipHash are generally fine.  Here, knowledge
 * of the key authorizes you to do something to a kernel object (inject
 * packets to a network connection, or flood a hash table), and the
 * key is stored with the object being protected.  Once it goes away,
 * we no longer care if anyone knows the key.
 *
 * prandom_u32()
 * -------------
 *
 * For even weaker applications, see the pseudorandom generator
 * prandom_u32(), prandom_max(), and prandom_bytes().  If the random
 * numbers aren't security-critical at all, these are *far* cheaper.
 * Useful for self-tests, random error simulation, randomized backoffs,
 * and any other application where you trust that nobody is trying to
 * maliciously mess with you by guessing the "random" numbers.
 *
 * Exported interfaces ---- input
 * ==============================
 *
 * The current exported interfaces for gathering environmental noise
 * from the devices are:
 *
 *	void add_device_randomness(const void *buf, unsigned int size);
 * 	void add_input_randomness(unsigned int type, unsigned int code,
 *                                unsigned int value);
 *	void add_interrupt_randomness(int irq);
 * 	void add_disk_randomness(struct gendisk *disk);
 *	void add_hwgenerator_randomness(const char *buffer, size_t count,
 *					size_t entropy);
 *	void add_bootloader_randomness(const void *buf, unsigned int size);
 *
 * add_device_randomness() is for adding data to the random pool that
 * is likely to differ between two devices (or possibly even per boot).
 * This would be things like MAC addresses or serial numbers, or the
 * read-out of the RTC. This does *not* add any actual entropy to the
 * pool, but it initializes the pool to different values for devices
 * that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy
 * available to them (particularly common in the embedded world).
 *
 * add_input_randomness() uses the input layer interrupt timing, as well as
 * the event type information from the hardware.
 *
 * add_interrupt_randomness() uses the interrupt timing as random
 * inputs to the entropy pool. Using the cycle counters and the irq source
 * as inputs, it feeds the randomness roughly once a second.
 *
 * add_disk_randomness() uses what amounts to the seek time of block
 * layer request events, on a per-disk_devt basis, as input to the
 * entropy pool. Note that high-speed solid state drives with very low
 * seek times do not make for good sources of entropy, as their seek
 * times are usually fairly consistent.
 *
 * All of these routines try to estimate how many bits of randomness a
 * particular randomness source.  They do this by keeping track of the
 * first and second order deltas of the event timings.
 *
 * add_hwgenerator_randomness() is for true hardware RNGs, and will credit
 * entropy as specified by the caller. If the entropy pool is full it will
 * block until more entropy is needed.
 *
 * add_bootloader_randomness() is the same as add_hwgenerator_randomness() or
 * add_device_randomness(), depending on whether or not the configuration
 * option CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is set.
 *
 * Ensuring unpredictability at system startup
 * ============================================
 *
 * When any operating system starts up, it will go through a sequence
 * of actions that are fairly predictable by an adversary, especially
 * if the start-up does not involve interaction with a human operator.
 * This reduces the actual number of bits of unpredictability in the
 * entropy pool below the value in entropy_count.  In order to
 * counteract this effect, it helps to carry information in the
 * entropy pool across shut-downs and start-ups.  To do this, put the
 * following lines an appropriate script which is run during the boot
 * sequence:
 *
 *	echo "Initializing random number generator..."
 *	random_seed=/var/run/random-seed
 *	# Carry a random seed from start-up to start-up
 *	# Load and then save the whole entropy pool
 *	if [ -f $random_seed ]; then
 *		cat $random_seed >/dev/urandom
 *	else
 *		touch $random_seed
 *	fi
 *	chmod 600 $random_seed
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=512
 *
 * and the following lines in an appropriate script which is run as
 * the system is shutdown:
 *
 *	# Carry a random seed from shut-down to start-up
 *	# Save the whole entropy pool
 *	echo "Saving random seed..."
 *	random_seed=/var/run/random-seed
 *	touch $random_seed
 *	chmod 600 $random_seed
 *	dd if=/dev/urandom of=$random_seed count=1 bs=512
 *
 * For example, on most modern systems using the System V init
 * scripts, such code fragments would be found in
 * /etc/rc.d/init.d/random.  On older Linux systems, the correct script
 * location might be in /etc/rcb.d/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.0.
 *
 * Effectively, these commands cause the contents of the entropy pool
 * to be saved at shut-down time and reloaded into the entropy pool at
 * start-up.  (The 'dd' in the addition to the bootup script is to
 * make sure that /etc/random-seed is different for every start-up,
 * even if the system crashes without executing rc.0.)  Even with
 * complete knowledge of the start-up activities, predicting the state
 * of the entropy pool requires knowledge of the previous history of
 * the system.
 *
 * Configuring the /dev/random driver under Linux
 * ==============================================
 *
 * The /dev/random driver under Linux uses minor numbers 8 and 9 of
 * the /dev/mem major number (#1).  So if your system does not have
 * /dev/random and /dev/urandom created already, they can be created
 * by using the commands:
 *
 * 	mknod /dev/random c 1 8
 * 	mknod /dev/urandom c 1 9
 *
 * Acknowledgements:
 * =================
 *
 * Ideas for constructing this random number generator were derived
 * from Pretty Good Privacy's random number generator, and from private
 * discussions with Phil Karn.  Colin Plumb provided a faster random
 * number generator, which speed up the mixing function of the entropy
 * pool, taken from PGPfone.  Dale Worley has also contributed many
 * useful ideas and suggestions to improve this driver.
 *
 * Any flaws in the design are solely my responsibility, and should
 * not be attributed to the Phil, Colin, or any of authors of PGP.
 *
 * Further background information on this topic may be obtained from
 * RFC 1750, "Randomness Recommendations for Security", by Donald
 * Eastlake, Steve Crocker, and Jeff Schiller.

 *
 * Thanks to Colin Plumb for suggesting this.
 *
 * The mixing operation is much less sensitive than the output hash,
 * where we use SHA-1.  All that we want of mixing operation is that
 * it be a good non-cryptographic hash; i.e. it not produce collisions
 * when fed "random" data of the sort we expect to see.  As long as
 * the pool state differs for different inputs, we have preserved the
 * input entropy and done a good job.  The fact that an intelligent
 * attacker can construct inputs that will produce controlled
 * alterations to the pool's state is not important because we don't
 * consider such inputs to contribute any randomness.  The only
 * property we need with respect to them is that the attacker can't
 * increase his/her knowledge of the pool's state.  Since all
 * additions are reversible (knowing the final state and the input,
 * you can reconstruct the initial state), if an attacker has any
 * uncertainty about the initial state, he/she can only shuffle that
 * uncertainty about, but never cause any collisions (which would
 * decrease the uncertainty).
 *
 * Our mixing functions were analyzed by Lacharme, Roeck, Strubel, and
 * Videau in their paper, "The Linux Pseudorandom Number Generator
 * Revisited" (see: http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/251.pdf).  In their
 * paper, they point out that we are not using a true Twisted GFSR,
 * since Matsumoto & Kurita used a trinomial feedback polynomial (that
 * is, with only three taps, instead of the six that we are using).
 * As a result, the resulting polynomial is neither primitive nor
 * irreducible, and hence does not have a maximal period over
 * GF(2**32).  They suggest a slight change to the generator
 * polynomial which improves the resulting TGFSR polynomial to be
 * irreducible, which we have made here.

 *
 * add_device_randomness() adds data to the input pool that

 * This would be things like MAC addresses or serial numbers, or the
 * read-out of the RTC. This does *not* credit any actual entropy to
 * the pool, but it initializes the pool to different values for devices
 * that might otherwise be identical and have very little entropy
 * available to them (particularly common in the embedded world).
 *
 * add_hwgenerator_randomness() is for true hardware RNGs, and will credit
 * entropy as specified by the caller. If the entropy pool is full it will
 * block until more entropy is needed.
 *
 * add_bootloader_randomness() is called by bootloader drivers, such as EFI
 * and device tree, and credits its input depending on whether or not the
 * configuration option CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER is set.
 *
 * add_interrupt_randomness() uses the interrupt timing as random
 * inputs to the entropy pool. Using the cycle counters and the irq source
 * as inputs, it feeds the input pool roughly once a second or after 64
 * interrupts, crediting 1 bit of entropy for whichever comes first.
 *
 * add_input_randomness() uses the input layer interrupt timing, as well
 * as the event type information from the hardware.
 *
 * add_disk_randomness() uses what amounts to the seek time of block
 * layer request events, on a per-disk_devt basis, as input to the
 * entropy pool. Note that high-speed solid state drives with very low
 * seek times do not make for good sources of entropy, as their seek
 * times are usually fairly consistent.
 *
 * The last two routines try to estimate how many bits of entropy
 * to credit. They do this by keeping track of the first and second

 * Sysctl interface.
 *
 * These are partly unused legacy knobs with dummy values to not break
 * userspace and partly still useful things. They are usually accessible
 * in /proc/sys/kernel/random/ and are as follows:
 *
 * - boot_id - a UUID representing the current boot.
 *
 * - uuid - a random UUID, different each time the file is read.
 *
 * - poolsize - the number of bits of entropy that the input pool can
 *   hold, tied to the POOL_BITS constant.
 *
 * - entropy_avail - the number of bits of entropy currently in the
 *   input pool. Always <= poolsize.
 *
 * - write_wakeup_threshold - the amount of entropy in the input pool
 *   below which write polls to /dev/random will unblock, requesting
 *   more entropy, tied to the POOL_READY_BITS constant. It is writable
 *   to avoid breaking old userspaces, but writing to it does not
 *   change any behavior of the RNG.
 *
 * - urandom_min_reseed_secs - fixed to the value CRNG_RESEED_INTERVAL.
